            <p>Hi, welcome to visit my personal pages. I am now a senior student major in software engineering in Tongji University.
                When I was a freshman, I chose to major in mechanical and electronic. But not for long, I found I was interested in
                computer science and software development. Afterwards, I switched to Software Engineering, and that’s why I need to
                take one more year of basic courses after my freshman year. But I never regretted it, due to my great thirst of absorbing
                knowledge from what I’m interested in. However, because there were no systematic learning of programming courses before,
                I met some difficulties at the beginning, I also felt the gap compared with those outstanding students at our group, it
                rightly inspired me to throw 100 percent energy into study. Earning the final high GPA exactly was the proof of my learning
                enthusiasm and potential.</p>
            <p>In the first year after I changed my major, in addition to working hard to learn professional knowledge, design came into my mind.
                In order to master more knowledge of design, I selected several design courses as my electives. Additionally, I served as a graphic
                designer both in the Student Union and the Students' Association Union, involving in the design of brochures, handouts, and posters etc.,
                which guided me to harvest abundant design experience. And in this process, I mastered how to use software such as Adobe Ps, Ai, and Id.
                Furthermore, I persuaded the group leader to change their old-fashioned design mode to Customer-Centric design, by using the knowledge
                I learned from the elective Introduction to Design Thinking.</p>
            <p>At the same time, I first contacted the concept of Human-Computer Interaction, which integrating technology, design and psychology
                was very suitable for me because of my complex background and curiosity of multidisciplinary knowledge. Therefore, I sought the
                projects related to Human-Computer Interaction and actively participated in. In these projects, I was inclined to the front-end
                development section, but often involved in the whole programming task. I always played the role of coordinating leadership.
                On the one hand, I was responsible for the overall front-end programming, writing code by applying multiple frameworks and programming
                languages. On the other hand, I took charge of the assignment of the workload for team members. Especially, when I had the honor to
                have an internship in the MIT City Science Lab in Shanghai, I acquired an opportunity to cooperate with people with backgrounds in design,
                computer science, and Urban planning. Other than utilizing some data analysis methods I learned before, I also obtained the occasion to
                learn and try TensorFlow framework and cooperated with MIT researchers, which was a valuable research experience benefiting me a lot.
                Thanks to this experience, I further understood HCI and kept in touch with experts in this field.</p>
            <p>I always preferred to study the issues closing to real life. Therefore, when I learned that there was a project on security analysis
                of mobile advertisement to research devious advertisement behaviors, I was glad to accept the invitation of BUPT-PKU Mobile Privacy
                Lab to join it. During the research, I first investigated and classified the devious mobile advertisement content, then involved in
                the implementation of the framework for automated detection of devious ad contents. Besides, I constructed the training set of 1,200
                images and established a model based on YOLO, in order to identify the click-deceptive images. As a result, we found various new
                discoveries and identified numerous devious mobile advertisement. Furthermore, the paper MadDroid: Characterizing and Detecting Devious
                Ad Content for Android Apps which I participated as one of the named authors was recently submitted to a top-tier conference in the
                field of software engineering– International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2019). Our effort was recognized, and nothing
                could be better. </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, success didn’t always happen, academic research was not as easy as an application development. In the project of interactive
                personal knowledge graph user interface for the Inter service robot, as a researcher, I always considered those technical problems such
                as how to fix the bugs and how to shorten the response time, but didn’t pay enough attention to the in-time communication with our target users.
                Thus, we didn’t have a sufficient analysis about users’ operating habit, and that’s also why we didn’t get positive feedback in the user test
                after we finished the testing demo. Although the result of the user test was not satisfactory, whereas I admitted that’s a blessing happened.
                It taught me a lesson that never underestimated the importance of user survey and user test. Moreover, in order to keep the project in the right
                way, it was necessary to maintain communication with users, instead of divorcing oneself from the from real situation.</p>
            <p>Now I am a senior student, and will graduate from Tongji in next semester. In order to refine my professional skills through a further education,
                I decided to find a HCI graduate programme to continue my research in this interesting area. Would you like to give me a chance? </p>
